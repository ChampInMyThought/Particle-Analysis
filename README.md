# Instructions for Using Macros

This resource should prove to be helpful for anyone looking to measure droplet area, radius, and diameter using ImageJ software. However, it's important to note that the values provided in the script are specific to the presenter's test case usage, and may need to be adjusted for different scenarios. For more accurate measurements, it's recommended to modify certain values in the script, such as the set scale and threshold, according to your specific requirements.

## 🚀 General Usage
To use the macros, follow these steps:

1.) Open the "Plugins" menu and select "New" and then "Macro."

2.) Copy and paste the text from the relevant command files.

3.) Click "Run."

## 📄 Single Run with Macro
During a single run with the macro, the program will display all results.
⚠️ However, you must save all the results yourself.

We recommend using this function as an experimental test to observe the data before running it on the entire dataset.

## 🗂️ Batch Run with Macro
During a batch run with the macro, the program will prompt you for two folders:

1.) The folder where all the images are located

2.) The folder where you want to save the results (both .tif masks and .csv areas).

## ⚠️ In cases of exceptions, how can we calculate manually?
