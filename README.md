# Instructions for Using Macros

## üöÄ General Usage
To use the macros, follow these steps:

1.) Open the "Plugins" menu and select "New" and then "Macro."

2.) Copy and paste the text from the relevant command files.

3.) Click "Run."

## Single Run with Macro
During a single run with the macro, the program will display all results.
‚ö†Ô∏è However, you must save all the results yourself.

We recommend using this function as an experimental test to observe the data before running it on the entire dataset.

## Batch Run with Macro
During a batch run with the macro, the program will prompt you for two folders:

1.) The folder where all the images are located

2.) The folder where you want to save the results (both .tif masks and .csv areas).

## Q&A
If you have any questions about using the macros, you can ask me directly or via email.
