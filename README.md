# Instructions for Using Macros

I hope this is an excellent resource for anyone interested in measuring droplet area, radius, diameter using ImageJ software.
## 🚀 General Usage
To use the macros, follow these steps:

1.) Open the "Plugins" menu and select "New" and then "Macro."

2.) Copy and paste the text from the relevant command files.

3.) Click "Run."

## Single Run with Macro
During a single run with the macro, the program will display all results.
⚠️ However, you must save all the results yourself.

We recommend using this function as an experimental test to observe the data before running it on the entire dataset.

## Batch Run with Macro
During a batch run with the macro, the program will prompt you for two folders:

1.) The folder where all the images are located

2.) The folder where you want to save the results (both .tif masks and .csv areas).

## For exception cases, how to calculate manually ?
